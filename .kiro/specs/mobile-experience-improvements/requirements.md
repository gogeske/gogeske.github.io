# Mobile Experience Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Language Explorer app needs improvements to provide a seamless experience across all devices and viewports while maintaining our core design principle of simplicity and minimalism. The app should have consistent audio functionality, intuitive interactions, and responsive visual feedback that works universally rather than having different paradigms for different devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Audio Replay

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want to tap anywhere on the screen to replay the current phrase with audio, so that I can hear the pronunciation again without navigating to other controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps anywhere on the screen (excluding links and terminal) THEN the current phrase SHALL be spoken again
2. WHEN the app first loads on iOS THEN the audio system SHALL be properly initialized for speech synthesis
3. WHEN audio fails to play THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without visual indicators
4. IF speech synthesis is not available THEN the app SHALL continue to function without audio

### Requirement 2: Navigation Swipe Feedback

**User Story:** As a user on any device with touch capability, I want to see clear visual feedback when I swipe to navigate, so that I know my gesture was recognized and the app is responding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes left or right for navigation THEN the screen SHALL move visibly in the swipe direction
2. WHEN the swipe animation completes THEN the screen SHALL return to its original position smoothly
3. WHEN a swipe gesture is recognized THEN the movement SHALL be noticeable (minimum 15px) but not excessive
4. IF a swipe is too short or fast THEN the animation SHALL still provide feedback before returning to normal
5. WHEN swiping down from top edge THEN different behavior SHALL trigger (terminal access) vs navigation swipes

### Requirement 3: Universal Terminal Access

**User Story:** As a user on any device (mobile or desktop), I want to easily access the help terminal using a natural gesture, so that I can learn how to use the app without needing external documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes down from the top edge of the screen THEN the help terminal SHALL slide down from the top
2. WHEN a user swipes up on an open terminal THEN the terminal SHALL slide back up and hide
3. WHEN the terminal is open THEN the user SHALL be able to close it by tapping the close button
4. WHEN the terminal is open THEN the user SHALL be able to close it by tapping outside the terminal area
5. WHEN the terminal state changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and consistent across all viewports
6. WHEN accessed via keyboard (? key) THEN the same slide-from-top animation SHALL be used

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Audio Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want to hear the pronunciation of phrases in their native languages, so that I can learn proper pronunciation and enjoy the full experience of the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads on iOS THEN the speech synthesis SHALL be unlocked on first user interaction
2. WHEN a phrase is spoken THEN it SHALL use the appropriate language voice if available
3. WHEN speech synthesis fails THEN the error SHALL be logged but not displayed to the user
4. WHEN no appropriate voice is found THEN the system SHALL use the default voice
5. IF the device has no speech synthesis support THEN the app SHALL function normally without audio

### Requirement 5: Minimal Design Compliance

**User Story:** As a user who values clean design, I want the iOS fixes to maintain the app's minimal aesthetic, so that the interface remains uncluttered and focused on the core experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN iOS fixes are implemented THEN no additional visual indicators SHALL be added to the interface
2. WHEN audio plays or fails THEN no persistent visual feedback SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN gestures are performed THEN only temporary, subtle visual feedback SHALL be provided
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled silently with console logging only
