# Performance Optimization Tasks

## Image Optimization Tasks

### Task 1: Update Unsplash URLs for Responsive Sizing
- [ ] Identify all Unsplash image URLs in the codebase
- [ ] Create responsive image URL helper function
- [ ] Update background image URLs with responsive parameters:
  - [ ] Add `w=400` for mobile breakpoint
  - [ ] Add `w=800` for tablet breakpoint  
  - [ ] Add `w=1200` for desktop breakpoint
- [ ] Add WebP format parameter `&fm=webp` to all URLs
- [ ] Add quality parameter `&q=75` for compression

### Task 2: Implement Image Lazy Loading
- [ ] Create ImageLoader class for managing image loading
- [ ] Implement current image loading logic
- [ ] Add background preloading for 2-3 random images
- [ ] Use intersection observer for efficient loading detection
- [ ] Test image loading performance across devices

## JavaScript Performance Tasks

### Task 3: Extract Inline JavaScript
- [ ] Create new `app.js` file
- [ ] Move all inline `<script>` content to app.js
- [ ] Update HTML to reference external script with `defer` attribute
- [ ] Remove inline script blocks from HTML
- [ ] Test functionality after extraction

### Task 4: Implement Lazy Location Loading
- [ ] Refactor languageExplorer object structure
- [ ] Create on-demand location loading system
- [ ] Implement memory management (max 10 locations)
- [ ] Add location caching mechanism
- [ ] Update location selection logic to use lazy loading

### Task 5: Optimize Animation Cleanup
- [ ] Reduce flying text timeout from 3000ms to 2600ms
- [ ] Create animation manager for tracking active animations
- [ ] Add immediate cleanup on animation completion
- [ ] Implement memory leak prevention
- [ ] Test animation performance during extended use

### Task 6: Optimize Voice Caching
- [ ] Remove `updateVoicesCache()` from page load initialization
- [ ] Implement lazy voice initialization in `speakPhrase()`
- [ ] Add voice loading state management
- [ ] Test speech functionality with lazy loading
- [ ] Measure initial page load improvement

## Testing & Validation Tasks

### Task 7: Performance Measurement
- [ ] Measure baseline performance metrics
- [ ] Test image loading times before/after optimization
- [ ] Measure JavaScript load times and memory usage
- [ ] Validate 60-70% image loading improvement
- [ ] Validate 40-50% JavaScript performance improvement

### Task 8: Cross-Device Testing
- [ ] Test responsive images on mobile devices
- [ ] Test tablet breakpoint image loading
- [ ] Test desktop performance improvements
- [ ] Validate WebP support with JPEG fallbacks
- [ ] Test lazy loading behavior across browsers

### Task 9: User Experience Validation
- [ ] Test smooth background image transitions
- [ ] Validate speech synthesis performance
- [ ] Test location switching responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure no functionality regressions
- [ ] Validate memory usage during extended sessions

## Success Criteria
- ✅ 60-70% reduction in image loading time and bandwidth
- ✅ 40-50% faster initial page load
- ✅ Reduced memory usage during interactions
- ✅ Maintained functionality and user experience
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility preserved
